# Project 2
+ By: Gerald Walden
+ Production URL: <http://p2.geraldbrentwalden.me>

## Build strategy
*Put an x in the build strategy you used. Put an x in each if you tackled both.*
+ [ ] Integrated
+ [x] Comprehensive

## Outside resources
None outside documentation sources discussed in class, and searching Stack Overflow for information on "component not defined on instance but referenced during render" errors. 

## Notes for instructor
I have not committed more recent code changes because they ended up breaking the project further. The "Wager" input box always defaults to 25 regardless of user input. This seemed like a simple fix, but it turned out not to be. I regret now that I tried to refactor this project instead of starting over with something new. There were just too many poorly understood things building on each other for me to be able to get it all working properly.
