__Outline of features__

This is a blog site.

Homepage displays title, date and description tags for posts; user can click on title to view
a post on its own page. 
URL example for post number 1: <http://p3.geraldbrentwalden.me/posts/1>

On each post's individual page, there is an *Add to Favorites* button that will add that post to
the local-storage favorites database.

"Favorites" nav link will display a list of all the posts currently stored as favorites. Next to each
entry is a button that will allow the user to remove the accompanying post from favorites.

"Categories" page simply displays a list of all the tags present across all posts. A future upgrade to the site would
be to make these tags into links, clicking on which would return a list of all the posts with the chosen tag.

###Outside resources
I used class materials and forums, and referred to the official Vue documentation. Naturally I drew from the ZipFoods examples
for guidance on setting up the basic framework.
